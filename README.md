AngularJS is a JavaScript framework written in JavaScript.
AngularJS is distributed as a JavaScript file, and can be added to a web page with a script tag:

The ng-app directive defines an AngularJS application.
The ng-model directive binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, textarea) to application data.
